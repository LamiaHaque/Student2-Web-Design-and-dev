            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>Agriculture and renewable energy generation are highly weather dependent. Extreme weather events and weather variability may result in unstable annual crop production and insufficient income. As a result of climate change, extreme weather events are expected to increase, therefore business models are exposed to higher risks.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar power, can be impacted by weather patterns. However, advancements in forecasting technology have improved the predictability of weather-related risks.</p>
            <img src="/Users/lamiasadia/Documents/Web design and dev coursework/renewal-energy-header.webp" alt="Weather Image" style="width: 100; height: 100;">
            <p>Potential solutions to weather-related risks include diversifying renewable energy sources, investing in energy storage technologies, and implementing flexible grid systems.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="mobility">
            <h2>Mobility</h2>
            <p>The transport sector accounts for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Offering electric or hybrid vehicle tariffs and sustainable services, Allianz provides incentives for the adoption of low-emission cars and environmentally-friendly driving behavior.</p>
            <p>According to recent studies, transitioning to electric vehicles can significantly reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality in urban areas. However, challenges such as limited infrastructure and high upfront costs hinder widespread adoption.</p>
